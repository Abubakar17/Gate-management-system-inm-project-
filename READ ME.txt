Steps to follow:
- Open simulation file using proteus simulation software.
- Double click the arduino and set the code path to the .ino file in this folder.
- Run the simualtion

Keep in mind: 
- The output toggle represents the servo motor; when the output is 1 the servo motor rotates, granting access and vice versa.
- The input to be given is the TAG ID which is fixed and can be found in the code file.
- The code for simulation and hardware are different since some modules like the hc05 or the rifd module couldnt be simulated.
